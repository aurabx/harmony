Here is a detailed explanation and documentation of the `Envelope` struct and its context in the project:

---

## **`Envelope` Overview**

The `Envelope` is a core utility in the project, designed to encapsulate and exchange data within the system. It provides a normalized and context-aware mechanism for passing structured data between endpoints, backends, and middleware layers in the proxy architecture.

### **Purpose**
- Acts as a container to transport data (`original_data`) along with metadata (`request_details`).
- Supports normalization of original data into a JSON format (`normalized_data`) for middleware or backend processing.

### **Definition**
The `Envelope` utilizes generics to handle flexible data types and relies on `serde` for serialization and deserialization â€” ensuring compatibility with APIs and config protocols.

---

### **`Envelope` Structure**

#### **Type Declaration**
```rust
pub struct Envelope<T> {
    pub request_details: RequestDetails,
    pub original_data: T,
    pub normalized_data: Option<serde_json::Value>,
}
```


#### **Fields**
1. **`request_details`**:
    - Type: [`RequestDetails`](#requestdetails-structure)
    - Description: Contains metadata about the incoming HTTP request such as headers, URI, and method.

2. **`original_data`**:
    - Type: Generic (`T`)
    - Description: The unprocessed data received by the system, passed along to middleware, backends, or endpoints.

3. **`normalized_data`**:
    - Type: `Option<serde_json::Value>`
    - Description: A JSON-normalized representation of the `original_data` to ensure compatibility with other systems.

---

### **`RequestDetails` Structure**

#### **Type Declaration**
```rust
pub struct RequestDetails {
    pub method: String,
    pub uri: String,
    pub headers: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```


#### **Fields**
1. **`method`**:
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: The HTTP method of the request (e.g., `GET`, `POST`).

2. **`uri`**:
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: The request URI or path.

3. **`headers`**:
    - Type: `HashMap<String, String>`
    - Description: A collection of HTTP header keys and values from the request.

4. **`metadata`**:
    - Type: `HashMap<String, String>`
    - Description: Additional metadata about the request, if applicable.

---

### **Implementation**

#### Constructor:
The `Envelope` struct provides the `new` function, which initializes an instance with:
- Request data (`request_details`).
- Original payload (`original_data`).
- Automatically normalizes the `original_data` into JSON (`normalized_data`).

```rust
impl<T> Envelope<T>
where
    T: Serialize,
{
    pub fn new(request_details: RequestDetails, original_data: T) -> Self {
        let normalized_data = serde_json::to_value(&original_data).ok();
        Envelope {
            request_details,
            original_data,
            normalized_data,
        }
    }
}
```


---

### **Key Features**
1. **Normalization**:
   The `normalized_data` field is automatically populated by serializing `original_data` into a `serde_json::Value`. This facilitates compatibility with middleware and backends that process JSON data.

2. **Flexibility**:
    - The generic type parameter (`T`) allows the Envelope to wrap diverse data payloads, making it adaptable for various domains (e.g., HTTP requests, DICOM payloads, or FHIR resources).
    - Its design ensures separation of concerns by isolating raw data (`original_data`) from its normalized counterpart.

---

### **Use Case in the Project**

The `Envelope` is central to the project's architecture and operates as a bridge between endpoints, middleware, and backends:

#### **Integration Points**
- **In Middleware**:
  Middleware can inspect `Envelope` data, transform it, or enrich it with additional metadata. For example, the `fhir_dicom_transform` middleware might process `normalized_data` to map FHIR endpoints into DICOM attributes.

- **In Backends**:
  The JSON-normalized view ensures that backends like FHIR or DICOM systems receive data in a predictable structure.

#### **Example Initialization**
```rust
let request_details = RequestDetails {
    method: "POST".to_string(),
    uri: "/api/resource".to_string(),
    headers: HashMap::new(),
    metadata: HashMap::new(),
};

let data = vec!["item1", "item2"];
let envelope = Envelope::new(request_details, data);
```


The `envelope` object now contains:
- Metadata about the request.
- Original payload.
- A normalized representation of serialized data.

---

### **Related Components**

#### 1. **Router Integration**
The `proxy_router.rs` contains handlers for processing requests and directly utilizes aspects of `RequestDetails`. Any incoming HTTP request will feed its metadata into `RequestDetails` for further handling.

#### 2. **Middleware Pipelines**
Middleware chains detailed in the configuration (e.g., `fhir_dicom_transform`, `jwt_auth`) can use `Envelope` instances to extract or transform data.

#### 3. **Configuration Context**
Files like `fhir-dicom.toml` and `todo.txt` reveal how different backends and middleware work with the `Envelope` structure.

    Example:
```toml
[middleware.fhir_dicom_transform]
    # Processes Envelope normalized_data
```


#### 4. **Testing**
The tests defined in `router_runs.rs` mock HTTP requests and assert how metadata (`RequestDetails`) propagates through the pipeline, verifying that the Envelope facilitates normalized payload delivery.

#### 5. **Endpoint Extensions**
Custom endpoints (e.g., in `custom.rs`) can extend functionality by defining specialized behavior using `Envelope`.

### **Advantages and Design Goals**
The `Envelope` is engineered with key architectural considerations:
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures all internal data communication uses a predictable structure.
- **Encapsulation**: Reduces coupling between middleware, routers, and backends by standardizing data representation.
- **Extensibility**: The generic approach ensures compatibility with diverse data types.
- **JSON Interoperability**: Provides seamless integration with JSON-based APIs and systems.

### **Future Enhancements**
- **Error Handling**: Introduce stricter error handling or logging for failed JSON normalization.
- **Middleware Hooks**: Expose hooks in `Envelope` for transformation at distinct lifecycle stages (e.g., pre-processing, post-processing).
- **Validation**: Include schema-based validation for `original_data` to enforce structural contracts.
