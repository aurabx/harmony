# DICOMweb Bridge: IncludeField Implementation Fix

## Problem

The DICOMweb Bridge middleware was not correctly implementing the `includefield` query parameter. While it was parsing the parameter and using it for response filtering on the right side, it wasn't passing the specified fields as return keys to the underlying DCMTK tools (`findscu`) on the left side.

This resulted in:
- DCMTK commands receiving only default return keys instead of user-specified fields
- Missing attributes in C-FIND responses
- Incorrect response filtering that couldn't find the requested attributes

## Root Cause

The issue was in the left-side middleware logic in `src/models/middleware/types/dicomweb_bridge.rs`:

1. **Includefield parsing**: The middleware correctly extracted `includefield` parameters from query params
2. **Default return keys**: When no `includefield` was provided, appropriate default return keys were added
3. **Missing logic**: When `includefield` WAS provided, the middleware only stored it for right-side filtering but didn't add the specified fields as return keys to the DIMSE identifier

This meant that DCMTK commands like:
```bash
findscu -k "StudyInstanceUID=" -k "PatientID=" # (defaults)
```

Should have become:
```bash
findscu -k "PatientName=" -k "StudyDate=" # (from includefield)
```

But instead remained as defaults, causing the DICOM backend to not return the requested attributes.

## Solution

### 1. Added Helper Function

Created `add_return_key_if_missing()` to safely add return keys without overwriting existing search criteria:

```rust
fn add_return_key_if_missing(ident: &mut serde_json::Map<String, Value>, field_name: &str) {
    let tag_hex = Self::dicom_name_to_hex(field_name);
    // Only add if not already present (preserves search criteria)
    if !ident.contains_key(&tag_hex) {
        let vr = Self::infer_vr_for_tag(&tag_hex);
        Self::add_tag(ident, &tag_hex, &vr, vec![]);
    }
}
```

### 2. Updated Return Key Logic

Modified the `add_return_keys` closure to properly handle `includefield`:

```rust
match includefield {
    Some(ref fields) => {
        // Add return keys for each field in includefield
        for field in fields {
            Self::add_return_key_if_missing(ident, field);
        }
    }
    None => {
        // No includefield specified - add default return keys for the level
        Self::add_default_return_keys(ident, level);
    }
}
```

### 3. Preserved Existing Behavior

- When no `includefield` is provided → uses default return keys (unchanged)
- When `includefield` is provided → uses only those fields as return keys
- Search criteria (non-empty query parameters) are preserved and not overwritten

## Key Benefits

1. **Standards Compliance**: Now correctly implements DICOMweb `includefield` parameter
2. **Efficient Queries**: DCMTK commands only request needed attributes
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing behavior for queries without `includefield` is unchanged
4. **Proper Filtering**: Both C-FIND requests and response filtering work correctly

## Testing

Added comprehensive unit tests covering:

1. **`test_includefield_adds_return_keys`**: Verifies includefield tags are added as return keys
2. **`test_no_includefield_uses_defaults`**: Ensures backward compatibility with default behavior  
3. **`test_includefield_preserves_search_criteria`**: Confirms search parameters aren't overwritten by return keys

## Example Flow

### Before Fix:
```
QIDO Request: GET /studies?includefield=PatientName&includefield=StudyDate
↓
findscu -k "StudyInstanceUID=" -k "PatientID=" -k "AccessionNumber=" # (defaults)
↓ 
Backend returns full metadata (ignoring includefield)
↓
Response filtered to PatientName, StudyDate (but data might be missing)
```

### After Fix:
```
QIDO Request: GET /studies?includefield=PatientName&includefield=StudyDate  
↓
findscu -k "PatientName=" -k "StudyDate="  # (from includefield)
↓
Backend returns only PatientName, StudyDate attributes
↓
Response contains exactly the requested fields
```

## Impact

This fix ensures that the DICOMweb Bridge middleware correctly implements the DICOMweb standard's `includefield` parameter, providing efficient and accurate DICOM C-FIND operations that only retrieve the attributes specifically requested by the client.
